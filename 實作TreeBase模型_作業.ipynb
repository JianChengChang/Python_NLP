       " 'This book was very informative, covering all aspects of game.',\n",
       " 'I am already a baseball fan and knew a bit about the Negro leagues, but I learned a lot more reading this book.',\n",
       " \"This was a good story of the Black leagues. I bought the book to teach in my high school reading class. I found it very informative and exciting. I would recommend to anyone interested in the history of the black leagues. It is well written, unlike a book of facts. The McKissack's continue to write good books for young audiences that can also be enjoyed by adults!\",\n",
       " 'Today I gave a book about the Negro Leagues of Baseball to a traveling friend. Its a book I\\'ve read more than once and felt that my friend would truly enjoy. It felt like giving a gift that you wanted to keep for yourself. I parted with the book knowing that my friend would enjoy reading it on his journey back east. Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it. I know I\\'ll come across the book again, but for me, parting with books is like wishing a friend well on a journey, just as this friend of mine was journeying. Its great to send a visiting friend off with a friendly gift.\\n\\nWell, in leafing through the book\\'s pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.\\n\\nexcerpt from Black Diamond:  \"Only one thing is keeping them out of the big leagues, and that is the pigmentation of their skin.\" Shirley Povich washington post',\n",
       " 'The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)',\n",

I also would've liked to see more than one or two pages of Aisling illustrations.\\n\\nThat said, it's pretty much exactly how it's billed, and it's a really pretty (and really big) book that definitely showcases how gorgeous the movie was.

While some art books end up focusing on one aspect of it's respective movie, 'Desiging the Secret of Kells' explores not only how the creators painstakingly captured its beautiful art style, but also looks into character design, production process, story boarding and writing, and  much more. From the caption and footnotes in the book tells how much the creators are passionate about and love this masterpiece. Just flipping through this book was a joy. You have to read it to believe it. :>\",\n",

As I write this I am attending the 2014 San Diego Comic Con. I was so stoked. Anyway, the book not just discusses the film but is very transparent in detailing the process. Even down to giving the color codes of the characters like their eye lash color. Very cool and detailed. If you get your hands on one get it. This will be one that the resale value will remain solid.

(Most pictures of brush stands show them holding the brush at the comb, but I think that looks weird and top-heavy.  Call me weird, then.)  The arms are too narrow for the Omega.  I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.

How do you dry it?  I don't know.  Perhaps by turning it on its side until it air dries.  In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.  I guess the unit is okay as long as you can leave it out, but I would still recommend placing it on  a dry paper towel after shaving to prevent mildew from forming and, worse, spreading.

The smaller bracket is 1/2 inches across. The outer 3/8 in or so of the brackets are bent upwards to prevent your brush or razor from sliding off accidentally.

The base is pretty heavy, which keeps it upright when the brush and razor are resting on it.  The Perfect Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand hold the Escali and Merkur perfectly.

It is a very solid, well constructed hanger for both the brush and some razors.  The razor hanging side does not work for my particular razor (Mach 3 which is a rather dated design by a major manufacturer) but the brush holder is a must to help keep you beaver brush rinsed clean and allowed to dry.  The product comes with instructions for disassembly and thorough cleaning of the stand which I really appreciate.  The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?\\nMy primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.  In addition it is well made and based on the quality of construction I anticipate that the finish and the stand will hold up for several years of everyday use.  I took the time to write this because I was impressed with the overall quality which I find to be a rarity these days.',\n",
